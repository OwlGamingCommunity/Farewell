OwlGaming has a long history of delivering fun experiences on roleplay games. It is our bread and butter. The community that we have grown has fostered international relationships from across the globe (some even meeting their lifelong partner through Owl). Started by Maxime in 2014, Chaos took the mantle in hitting record high player counts on MTA and the development of our GTAV server.

Unfortunately, we have been unable to break into the GTAV market significantly enough to sustain ourselves. We have made the difficult decision to shut down the GTAV server. There is no single reason for this. We do not feel that the current script is something we develop to a point we are happy with. For this reason we have chosen to open source both the MTA and GTAV code. We welcome developers to contribute to those projects and make them the standard for roleplay communities on MTA and RageMP. The server was finally shutdown on **July 12th, 2021 at 11pm UTC** after running since January 2014.
